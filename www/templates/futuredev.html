      <p>It is said that a piece of software is never <i>really</i> finished and this application is no exception.  The list below outlines some of the plans I have to further develop
      this application to maximize its utility.  If you have suggestions, feel free to email me at : shelleydaviswise@gmail.com </p>
      <ol>
         <li> User name and password authorization - originally a working part of the application, to be technical about it, something broke and I had to remove it for the time being.</li>
         <li> The ability to edit parameters associated with each child and keep a record of the changes.</li>
         <li> The ability to delete children from the application.</li>
         <li> The ability to associate an image with each child</li>
         <li> A more dynamic calculation of allowance increment. As it stands, each child's allowance is calculated based on a daily rate multiplied by the static number of days since being added to the app.  I would like the increment to act independently of a static point.  Doing so would allow for easier transition to edited parameters.
